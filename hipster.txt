GitHub was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[16] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.[17]

In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to harassment allegations against its co-founder and then-CEO, Thomas Preston-Werner, and his wife Theresa. As a result of the scandal, Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[18] Co-founder and Product lead, Chris Wanstrath, became CEO. Julio Avalos, then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed control over GitHub's business operations and day-to-day management.[19]
